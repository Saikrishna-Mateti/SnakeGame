# SnakeGame
I created a game using java framework called Swing .

- Game looks like this when it is compilied .
 Snake starts at right side corner every time game starts and apple or red dot appears at random place in X-axis and Y-axis of digital screen

- When snake is attached or touches any corner of the X-axis and Y-axis of the panel then game . A screen pops-up showing that "GAME OVER" and there is Score counter top middle of the panel. When ever snake touches the red dot score increase by one and Score calculate the total one of points.
